## Hey, I'm Abdullah 👋

I spend way too much time building mechanical stuff like little robots, CAD experiments, weird mechanisms, and anything else that seems like a good idea at 2 a.m.

I’m always picking up something new (usually a tool I should’ve learned months ago) and trying to make my simulations look less chaotic. If you’re into mechanical design, robotics, or troubleshooting why a part suddenly decides it wants to intersect with reality, we’ll get along great.

You’ll find a mix of experiments, half-finished prototypes, “quick” designs that took five hours, and the occasional project that actually works on the first try.
